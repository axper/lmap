# Preface
It is a common job of system administrators to perform port scans of their systems.
Such scans help the administrators to find vulnerabilities in the system earlier than a possible attacker.
To perform such scans administrators use tools like nmap, nessus, accunetix which scan all possible ports from the
outside and report the open ports and found vulnerabilities to the administrator. However, this has a few downsides:

Scanning every TCP and UDP often requires a lot of time and network resources and can in certain cases disrupt the
network flow, or even trigger a false alarm in IDS.

In this document, we present an alternative way of evaluating server vulnerabilities which scans the system for
vulnerabilities from the inside, as opposed to the outside.

This program leaves a lot of thinking to the user,
